# Week 2: Bayes and Naive Bayes Classification (GaussianNB)
**Topics**: Bayes’ theorem, Naive Bayes classification, Gaussian Naive Bayes

- (assertion) Bayes’ theorem relates prior and posterior probabilities: P(A|B) = [P(B|A)*P(A)]/P(B).
- (assertion) Naive Bayes assumes independence between features given the class, simplifying probability computations.
- (assertion) GaussianNB uses continuous features modeled with Gaussian distributions for each class.

**Tasks**:
- Apply Bayes’ theorem to compute posterior probabilities for simple classification scenarios.
- Implement GaussianNB on a known dataset (e.g., Iris data) using scikit-learn: fit the model and evaluate its accuracy.
- Compare model predictions with actual classes to understand model performance.
