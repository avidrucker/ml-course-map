# Week 1: Basic Probability
**Topics**: Probability basics, Sample space and events, Conditional probability, Independent events, Mutually exclusive events

- (assertion) The probability of an event is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of equally likely outcomes in the sample space.
- (assertion) The sum of probabilities of all mutually exclusive outcomes in a sample space is 1.
- (assertion) Two events are independent if knowing one event’s outcome does not affect the probability of the other.
- (assertion) The law of total probability allows us to express P(A) in terms of P(A|B) and P(A|B^c).
- (assertion) Conditional probability P(B|A) = P(A∩B)/P(A) helps revise probabilities when partial information is known.

**Tasks**:
- Compute the probability of events for coin tosses and die rolls by enumerating sample spaces.
- Use conditional probability to determine P(B|A) in dice problems.
- Determine whether events are independent or mutually exclusive using given probability values.
- Apply the law of total probability to find P(A) given partial distributions.
