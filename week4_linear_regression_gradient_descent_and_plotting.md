# Week 4: Linear Regression, Gradient Descent, and Plotting
**Topics**: Linear regression concept, Hypothesis function, Gradient descent, Data plotting (matplotlib)

- (assertion) Linear regression fits a line y = a + b*x to minimize the sum of squared residuals.
- (assertion) Gradient descent is an iterative method to find parameters (a, b) that minimize the cost function.
- (assertion) Matplotlib allows plotting data, lines, and multiple subplots, facilitating data visualization.

**Tasks**:
- Derive the normal equations for simple linear regression and solve for a and b (intercept and slope).
- Implement gradient descent for a small dataset to approximate a linear regression line.
- Plot data points and the resulting regression line using matplotlib subplots, add titles, labels, and legends.
- Experiment with changing figure size, shared axes, and multiple subplots to improve data visualization.
