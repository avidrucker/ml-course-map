# Week 5: Linear Regression with scikit, Multi-variable Regression, R-squared Goodness of Fit
**Topics**: scikit-learn LinearRegression, Multi-variable regression, Evaluating regression with R²

- (assertion) The scikit-learn `LinearRegression` model finds best-fit parameters for linear regression automatically.
- (assertion) Multi-variable regression extends linear regression to multiple features, fitting a hyperplane in higher dimensions.
- (assertion) R² (coefficient of determination) measures what fraction of variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model.

**Tasks**:
- Use `LinearRegression` from scikit-learn on a dataset with one feature, check intercept and coefficient.
- Extend to multi-variable regression: fit a model using multiple features (e.g., wine quality dataset) and interpret coefficients.
- Compute R² for the fitted model and explain its meaning in terms of goodness of fit.
- Compare R² across different models or subsets of features to determine which model better explains the data.
