# Week 8: Logistic Regression Threshold Tuning

**Logistic Regression (topic)**  
- (assertion) Changing the decision threshold in logistic regression directly affects metrics like precision and recall, allowing the model to be tuned for different operational requirements.

**Evaluation Metrics (topic)**  
- (assertion) Adjusting the decision threshold modifies the confusion matrix and thus all derived metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.  
- (task) Experiment with different thresholds in logistic regression and plot metrics (precision, recall) against the threshold to identify a suitable operating point.
